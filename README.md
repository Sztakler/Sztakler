# Hello there! 👋

Hi, I'm Krystian. I'm a amateur web and game developer working with my close friends in Kiki/Bouba Game Studio.

## What is going on lately?

Here are some projects I've been workin' on recently:
- Pandask 🐼 -- task management tool
- Tenebriculum 🌙 -- fantasy RPG game with strong emphasis on narrative
- Octasm 🎱 -- Chip8 interpreter for Atmega microprocessors and desktops
- Basements & Earwigs 🎲 -- innovative tabletop RPG game
- a lot of small web projects ⌨️

## Technologies

I work mostly with Vue and React to develop web applications.

I'm also familiar with C and C++ programming and currently learning Rust for some low level programming. I'm also quite experienced with Python and C#.

For local scripting I use mainly bash.

When it comes to game development I took a liking to Godot and Unity:
